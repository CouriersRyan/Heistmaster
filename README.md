# Heistmaster  
Real-time top-down stealth tactics game framed around the concept of planning a heist using the blueprints as the level.  
The advanced programming concept I used was writing custom shaders in HLSL for diegetic UI elements and to change the view of the blueprints, as well as for atmosphere.   
Other things of note is building AI and unit behavior to interact with different objects in a scalable way.
